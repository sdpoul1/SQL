CVS Health
CVS Health is trying to better understand its pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find out which manufacturer is associated with the drugs that were not profitable and how much money CVS lost on these drugs. 

Output the manufacturer, number of drugs and total losses. Total losses should be in absolute value. Display the results with the highest losses on top.

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
units_sold	integer
total_sales	decimal
cogs	decimal
manufacturer	varchar
drug	varchar
pharmacy_sales Example Input:
product_id	units_sold	total_sales	cogs	manufacturer	drug
156	89514	3130097.00	3427421.73	Biogen	Acyclovir
25	222331	2753546.00	2974975.36	AbbVie	Lamivudine and Zidovudine

98	110746	813188.82	140422.87	Biogen	Medi-Chord
Example Output:
manufacturer	drug_count	total_loss
Biogen	1	297324.73
AbbVie	1	221429.36
Eli Lilly	1	221422.17
Explanation:
The drugs in the first 3 rows of the Example Input table reported losses. Biogen's losses were the highest followed by AbbVie's and Eli Lilly's.

Medi-Chord drug by Biogen reported a profit, so it was excluded from the result.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
